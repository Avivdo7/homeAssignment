# Basic Crypto Concepts 

## 1. Blockchain  
 A type of distributed ledger technology (DLT) where data is stored across a network of computers (nodes) rather than in a central location. Each block contains a list of transactions, a timestamp, and a cryptographic hash of the previous block, linking them together.

## 2. Smart Contract  
 Are self-executing programs stored on the blockchain that automatically enforce the terms of an agreement when predetermined conditions are met.

## 3. GAS Token  
The computational effort required to execute operations, such as transactions or smart contracts. Users pay gas fees in the network's native token.

## 4. ERC-20 Token
Is a standard for creating and issuing fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. These tokens are interchangeable, ERC-20 tokens follow a specific set of rules that enable compatibility with Ethereum wallets, exchanges, and decentralized applications

## 5. Wallet  
A digital tool that allows users to securely store, manage, and transact with their crypto assets, there are two main types hot wallets (online) and cold wallets offline which stores private keys which are necessary to authorize transactions.

## 6. ChainPort Bridge  
A blockchain bridge, like ChainPort, enables the transfer of tokens and assets between different blockchain networks, such as Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain.
